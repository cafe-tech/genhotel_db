Fluid Relational Database Schema intended for Hotel Software Development using MySQL (5.7.13).

ï¿½This is a database schema primarily intenteded for Hotel application development. It is created with the purpose of
Application-Driven design in mind, while still retaining some form of traditional/relational database design.

This is built using the MySQL Server Workbench (5.7.13) and lots of handwritten notes.

What to expect in the future:
- Accounting 
- Materials 
- Supplier
